There is a legendary tale about Dragon Balls on Planet X: if one collects seven Dragon Balls, the Dragon God will show up and help you fulfill your wishes.

One day, you are surprised to discover that the tale might possibly be true: you found a Dragon Ball radar at a flea market! The radar shows you the locations of the seven Dragon Balls on Planet X. You want to waste no time checking the truth of the old legend about wish-granting for yourself!

There are n cities in total on Planet X, numbered from 1 to n. You are currently at city 1. To travel from one city to another, you can take any of m bidirectional teleport trips, as many times as you like. The i-th teleporter costs t_i coins to use each time, and it can teleport you between cities a_i and b_i. To collect a Dragon Ball, you simply need to visit the city where it's located, as indicated on your radar. It is possible that multiple Dragon Balls are at the same city; in this case, you pick all of them up at once if you visit that city.

Your goal is to find the minimum number of coins needed to collect all seven Dragon Balls shown on the radar starting from city 1. If there is no way to complete this task, output `-1` instead.

This module is structured to include the problem statement, metadata, and a solution function. The solution uses a combination of graph traversal and dynamic programming with bitmasking to efficiently solve the problem of collecting all Dragon Balls with the minimum cost. The unit tests cover various scenarios to ensure the solution's correctness.
