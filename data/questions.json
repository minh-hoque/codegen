Your company publishes articles for each city about their local sports team. Each user is interested in exactly seven articles, each associated with a specific city.\n\nYou are given:\n- A list of `n` cities, numbered from 1 to `n`.\n- A list of `m` teleportation paths, where each path connects two cities and has a specific cost in coins. Users can use any teleportation path multiple times.\n- A list of seven city IDs representing the cities where the articles of interest are published.\n\nYour goal is to determine the minimum number of coins required for a user to visit all the cities associated with the articles they are interested in, starting from city 1. If it is impossible to visit all the required cities, return -1.\n\nWrite a function `min_coins_to_visit_articles` that computes this minimum cost.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The user always starts from city 1.\n- The user is interested in exactly seven articles, each associated with a city.\n- Cities are connected by teleportation paths, which can be used multiple times.\n- If a city is unreachable, the function should return -1.\n\n**Metadata**:\n\nInput:\n- `n` (int): The number of cities. Constraints: 1 <= n <= 1000\n- `m` (int): The number of teleportation paths. Constraints: 0 <= m <= min(200000, n*(n-1)/2)\n- `paths_costs` (list[tuple[int, int, int]]): A list of tuples, where each tuple consists of two cities (a_i, b_i) connected by a teleportation path and the cost to use the path (t_i). Constraints: 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, 0 <= t_i <= 10000\n- `articles` (list[int]): The city IDs of the seven articles the user is interested in. Constraints: 1 <= articles[i] <= n for each i from 1 to 7. Length 7\n\nOutput:\n- `min_coins` (int): The minimum number of coins needed to visit all the cities where the articles the user is interested in are published. If there is no way to visit all the cities, return -1.\n\nApproximate difficulty level: Medium\n\nProblem Category: Graph theory, Shortest path\n\n**Golden unit tests**:\n\nExample 1:\n```python\nn = 5\nm = 4\npaths_costs = [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 1)]\narticles = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5]\nassert min_coins_to_visit_articles(n, m, paths_costs, articles) == 3\n```\nExplanation: The user can take the path from city 1 to city 2, city 2 to city 3, city 3 to city 4, and city 4 to city 5 to visit all required cities. The total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\nExample 2:\n```python\nn = 5\nm = 5\npaths_costs = [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 1), (5, 1, 1)]\narticles = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1]\nassert min_coins_to_visit_articles(n, m, paths_costs, articles) == 4\n```\nExplanation: The user can take the path from city 1 to city 2, city 2 to city 3, city 3 to city 4, city 4 to city 5, and city 5 to city 1. The total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n\nExample 3:\n```python\nn = 5\nm = 5\npaths_costs = [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 1), (5, 6, 1)]\narticles = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5]\nassert min_coins_to_visit_articles(n, m, paths_costs, articles) == -1\n```\nExplanation: There is no path to city 6, so it's impossible to visit all the cities where the articles the user is interested in are published.",

      "test_validation": "Let's analyze each test case step by step:\n\n### Test Case #1:\n```python\nn = 5\nm = 4\npaths_costs = [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 1)]\narticles = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5]\nassert min_coins_to_visit_articles(n, m, paths_costs, articles) == 3\n```\n\n- **Input Analysis**: \n  - The inputs are valid and meet the problem constraints. There are 5 cities and 4 paths, which is within the allowed range. The articles list contains 7 city IDs, as required.\n  \n- **Edge Case Coverage**: \n  - This test case covers a straightforward scenario where all cities are connected in a linear path, and the user needs to visit each city once. It doesn't cover more complex graph structures or disconnected graphs.\n\n- **Output Verification**: \n  - The user starts at city 1 and needs to visit cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The path is linear: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5. The total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which matches the expected output.\n\n- **Correction**: \n  - The test is correct as is.\n\n- **Value Assessment**: \n  - This test adds value by confirming the function works for a simple linear path scenario.\n\n- **Recommendation**: \n  - The test is good. No changes needed.\n\n### Test Case #2:\n```python\nn = 5\nm = 5\npaths_costs = [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 1), (5, 1, 1)]\narticles = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1]\nassert min_coins_to_visit_articles(n, m, paths_costs, articles) == 4\n```\n\n- **Input Analysis**: \n  - The inputs are valid. There are 5 cities and 5 paths, and the articles list contains 7 city IDs.\n\n- **Edge Case Coverage**: \n  - This test case covers a scenario where the graph forms a cycle, allowing the user to return to the starting city. It tests the function's ability to handle cycles.\n\n- **Output Verification**: \n  - The user needs to visit cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and return to city 1. The path can be: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1. The total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, which matches the expected output.\n\n- **Correction**: \n  - The test is correct as is.\n\n- **Value Assessment**: \n  - This test adds value by testing the function's handling of cycles in the graph.\n\n- **Recommendation**: \n  - The test is good. No changes needed.\n\n### Test Case #3:\n```python\nn = 5\nm = 5\npaths_costs = [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 1), (5, 6, 1)]\narticles = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5]\nassert min_coins_to_visit_articles(n, m, paths_costs, articles) == -1\n```\n\n- **Input Analysis**: \n  - The inputs are valid. There are 5 cities and 5 paths, and the articles list contains 7 city IDs.\n\n- **Edge Case Coverage**: \n  - This test case covers a scenario where one of the cities (city 6) is unreachable from the starting city, testing the function's ability to detect disconnected graphs.\n\n- **Output Verification**: \n  - The user needs to visit cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. However, there is no path to city 6, making it impossible to visit all required cities. The expected output is -1, which is correct.\n\n- **Correction**: \n  - The test is correct as is.\n\n- **Value Assessment**: \n  - This test adds value by ensuring the function can handle cases where not all cities are reachable.\n\n- **Recommendation**: \n  - The test is good. No changes needed.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n1. **Test Suite Coverage Score (1-10)**: 7\n   - The test suite covers basic scenarios, including linear paths, cycles, and disconnected graphs. However, it could be improved by adding more complex scenarios, such as varying path costs and more intricate graph structures.\n\n2. **Missing Edge Cases**:\n   - Scenarios with varying path costs where the user must choose the cheapest path.\n   - Graphs with multiple disconnected components.\n   - Cases where the starting city is not part of the articles list.\n\n3. **Recommendations for Additional Tests**:\n   - Add tests with varying path costs to ensure the function finds the minimum cost path.\n   - Include tests with multiple disconnected components to verify the function returns -1 when necessary.\n   - Test cases where the starting city is not part of the articles list to ensure the function handles such scenarios correctly.",

      "generated_text": "**Problem Statement**:\n\nIn the bustling city of Pythontown, the local government has implemented a new policy to manage traffic congestion. Each vehicle is assigned a unique identifier, and sensor checkpoints are strategically placed throughout the city to monitor traffic flow. These sensors log the identifier of each vehicle as it enters or exits the city, along with the exact time of the event. To encourage efficient travel, the city imposes fines on vehicles that spend excessive time within city limits in a single day.\n\nYour task is to determine which vehicle spent the most total time within the city on a given day. If multiple vehicles have the same maximum time, return the vehicle with the smallest identifier. If no vehicles are detected within the city on that day, return -1.\n\nEach sensor log entry is represented as a tuple with three elements:\n1. An integer representing the vehicle's unique identifier.\n2. An integer representing the time in minutes past midnight when the vehicle passed the sensor.\n3. A boolean indicating whether the vehicle was entering (`True`) or exiting (`False`) the city.\n\nThe sensors are perfectly synchronized, allowing them to record multiple vehicles at the same exact time.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The list of sensor logs is sorted in non-decreasing order by time.\n- Each vehicle will have an even number of log entries, ensuring that every entry has a corresponding exit.\n- The number of log entries is between 0 and 1,000,000.\n- Vehicle identifiers are between 0 and 1,000,000.\n- Time is represented as an integer between 0 and 1439 (inclusive), corresponding to minutes past midnight.\n- The boolean value indicates entry (`True`) or exit (`False`).\n\n**Output**:\n- Return the identifier of the vehicle that spent the most time within the city. If there is a tie, return the vehicle with the smallest identifier.

Vehicle 2 has a lower identifier, so it is returned.\n\nTest Case 2:\n- **Input**: `[(1, 0, True), (1, 600, False), (2, 300, True), (2, 900, False), (3, 200, True), (3, 1000, False)]`\n- **Output**: `3`\n- **Explanation**: Vehicle 1 and 2 each spent 600 minutes, while vehicle 3 spent 800 minutes. Vehicle 3 is returned.\n\nTest Case 3:\n- **Input**: `[]`\n- **Output**: `-1`\n- **Explanation**: No vehicles were detected, so -1 is returned.\n\nTest Case 4:\n- **Input**: `[(1, 0, True), (1, 1439, False)]`\n- **Output**: `1`\n- **Explanation**: Vehicle 1 was in the city for 1439 minutes, the entire day, so it is returned.\n\nTest Case 5:\n- **Input**: `[(1, 0, True), (1, 600, False), (2, 0, True), (2, 600, False), (3, 0, True), (3, 600, False)]`\n- **Output**: `1`\n- **Explanation**: All vehicles spent 600 minutes in the city.

Our sample output should be corrected accordingly.\n\nCorrected Sample Output 3:\n```python\nmin_cost = 50\n```\n\n---\n\nSample Input 4:\n```python\nn = 3\nm = 2\nroads_costs = [(1, 2, 5), (2, 3, 5)]\nstart = 1\npriority_cities = [3]\n```\nSample Output 4:\n```python\nmin_cost = 10\n```\nExplanation: The only path to reach city 3 from city 1 is through city 2, with a total cost of 10.\n\n---\n\nSample Input 5 (Impossible case):\n```python\nn = 4\nm = 2\nroads_costs = [(1, 2, 5), (3, 4, 5)]\nstart = 1\npriority_cities = [4]\n```\nSample Output 5:\n```python\nmin_cost = \"Impossible\"\n```\nExplanation: There is no path connecting the starting city (1) to the priority city (4), so it's impossible to visit all priority cities.\n\n---\n\n**Note**:\n- In Sample Input 3, upon careful calculation, the minimum cost must be corrected to reflect the accurate path that visits all priority cities at minimal cost, considering all possible routes.\n- If there are inconsistencies in the sample inputs or outputs (as found in the original problem statement), they have been corrected to ensure the problem is challenging and complies with the LeetCode Medium or Hard level standards.\n- The problem involves computing the shortest paths between a small set of important cities and using bitmask dynamic programming to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for these cities, which justifies its classification as a complex problem.",

One day, you stumble upon a radar at a flea market that reveals the locations of these Dragon Balls across Planet X. Intrigued by the legend, you decide to embark on a journey to collect them all.\n\nPlanet X consists of `n` cities, numbered from `1` to `n`. You start your quest in city `1`. To travel between cities, you can use any of the `m` available bidirectional teleporters. Each teleporter connects two cities, `a_i` and `b_i`, and costs `t_i` coins to use. You can use the teleporters as many times as needed.\n\nYour mission is to determine the minimum number of coins required to collect all seven Dragon Balls. If it is impossible to collect all of them, return `-1`.\n\n**Metadata**:\n- **Input**:\n  - `n` (int): The number of cities. Constraints: 1 <= n <= 200,000\n  - `m` (int): The number of teleporters. Constraints: 1 <= m <= 200,000\n  - `trips_costs` (list[tuple[int, int, int]]): A list of `m` tuples, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `t_i`, representing a teleporter between cities `a_i` and `b_i` with a cost of `t_i` coins. Constraints: 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, 0 <= t_i <= 10,000\n  - `c` (list[int]): A list of 7 integers representing the city IDs where each Dragon Ball is located.

The city has `n` taxis, each identified by a unique ID ranging from `1` to `n`. Each taxi can be in one of two states: **free** or **busy**. \n\nCustomers can book a taxi by specifying its ID, changing its state from **free** to **busy**. Once a ride is completed, the taxi returns to the **free** state. The system maintains a log for each taxi, recording the times at which its state changes. Each log entry is a tuple `(time, state)`, where `time` is a positive integer indicating when the state change occurred, and `state` is `0` for **busy** and `1` for **free**. The logs are sorted by time in ascending order. It is guaranteed that each taxi starts in the **free** state, and every transition to **busy** is eventually followed by a transition back to **free**.\n\nTo improve efficiency, the city has introduced a new booking system where customers can request any available taxi. The system will assign the taxi that has been free for the longest duration at the current time. If multiple taxis have been free for the same duration, the taxi with the smallest ID is chosen. If no taxis are free, the system should return `-1`.\n\nImplement the function `find_taxi(log, time)` that takes the taxi state log and the current time as inputs and returns the ID of the taxi that has been free for the longest time.
