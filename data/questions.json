      "generated_text": "**Problem Statement**:\n\nThere is a long known tale about a string called \"Golden String\" in a parallel universe. A \"Golden String\" is a string that contains two distinct characters and the difference between the count of these two characters is at most 1. For example, \"abab\", \"babab\", \"ababa\", \"aabb\", \"bbaa\" are all golden strings but \"aabba\",\"aabbbaa\", \"abbbb\" are not.\n\nIn this parallel universe, there is a special device that can transform any string into a \"Golden String\". The transformation process involves the device removing any character from the string one by one. It should be noted that the device removes the character one at a time, not all occurrences of a character at once.\n\nNow, the problem is, the use of this device is quite expensive. Every time a character is removed, it costs 1 gem. You have a string and you want to transform it into a golden string using this device. Your task is to determine the minimum number of gems you need to spend to transform your given string into a golden string.\n\nWrite a python function,\n```python\n    def min_gems_to_transform(s:str) -> int:\n        pass\n```\n\n**Input:**\n- (s: str) -> a string. ( 1 <= len(s) <= 10^5, s contains only lower case English letters)\n\nThe function should return an integer, representing the minimum number of gems you need to spend to transform the given string into a golden string.\n\n**Output:**\n- return an integer, representing the minimum number of gems you need to spend to transform the given string into a golden string.\n\n**Metadata**\n- Input/output spec: explained above.\n- Approximate difficulty level: Leetcode \u201cHard\u201d\n- Problem Category: String\n- Approximate time: 120 minutes\n\n**Golden unit tests**:\n\n1. \"aaaabbbb\" -> 0.\n   - count of both 'a' and 'b' is 4. Thus, the string is already a \"Golden String\". Therefore, no gems are required to transform it into a 'Golden String'.\n\n2. \"aabba\" -> 1\n   - count of 'a' is 3 and count of 'b' is 2. We need to remove 1 'a' to make the string a 'Golden String'. Therefore, 1 gem is required.\n\n3. \"aabbca\" -> 1\n   - count of 'a' is 3, count of 'b' is 2 and count of 'c' is 1. We can remove 1 'c' to make the string a 'Golden String'. Therefore, 1 gem is required.\n\n4. \"aabbccc\" -> 2\n   - count of 'a' is 2, count of 'b' is 2 and count of 'c' is 3. We can remove 2 'c' to make the string a 'Golden String'. Therefore, 2 gems are required.\n\n5. \"abcde\" -> 3\n   - count of 'a','b','c','d' and 'e' is 1. We can remove 'c','d' and 'e' to make the string a 'Golden String'. Therefore, 3 gems are required.\n\n6. \"abcdefgh\" -> 6\n   - count of 'a' to 'h' is 1. We can remove 'c' to 'h' to make the string a 'Golden String'. Therefore, 6 gems are required.\n\n7. \"aaaabbbbccccc\" -> 2\n   - count of 'a' is 4, count of 'b' is 4 and count of 'c' is 5. We can remove 2 'c' to make the string a 'Golden String'. Therefore, 2 gems are required.",

You live in a city with `n` places, numbered from 1 to `n`. You are currently at place number 1 and you have a list of `m` places you want to visit.
