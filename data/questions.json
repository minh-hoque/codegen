      "generated_text": "**Problem Statement**:\n\nThere is a long known tale about a string called \"Golden String\" in a parallel universe. A \"Golden String\" is a string that contains two distinct characters and the difference between the count of these two characters is at most 1. For example, \"abab\", \"babab\", \"ababa\", \"aabb\", \"bbaa\" are all golden strings but \"aabba\",\"aabbbaa\", \"abbbb\" are not.\n\nIn this parallel universe, there is a special device that can transform any string into a \"Golden String\". The transformation process involves the device removing any character from the string one by one. It should be noted that the device removes the character one at a time, not all occurrences of a character at once.\n\nNow, the problem is, the use of this device is quite expensive. Every time a character is removed, it costs 1 gem. You have a string and you want to transform it into a golden string using this device. Your task is to determine the minimum number of gems you need to spend to transform your given string into a golden string.\n\nWrite a python function,\n```python\n    def min_gems_to_transform(s:str) -> int:\n        pass\n```\n\n**Input:**\n- (s: str) -> a string. ( 1 <= len(s) <= 10^5, s contains only lower case English letters)\n\nThe function should return an integer, representing the minimum number of gems you need to spend to transform the given string into a golden string.\n\n**Output:**\n- return an integer, representing the minimum number of gems you need to spend to transform the given string into a golden string.\n\n**Metadata**\n- Input/output spec: explained above.\n- Approximate difficulty level: Leetcode \u201cHard\u201d\n- Problem Category: String\n- Approximate time: 120 minutes\n\n**Golden unit tests**:\n\n1. \"aaaabbbb\" -> 0.\n   - count of both 'a' and 'b' is 4. Thus, the string is already a \"Golden String\". Therefore, no gems are required to transform it into a 'Golden String'.\n\n2. \"aabba\" -> 1\n   - count of 'a' is 3 and count of 'b' is 2. We need to remove 1 'a' to make the string a 'Golden String'. Therefore, 1 gem is required.\n\n3. \"aabbca\" -> 1\n   - count of 'a' is 3, count of 'b' is 2 and count of 'c' is 1. We can remove 1 'c' to make the string a 'Golden String'. Therefore, 1 gem is required.\n\n4. \"aabbccc\" -> 2\n   - count of 'a' is 2, count of 'b' is 2 and count of 'c' is 3. We can remove 2 'c' to make the string a 'Golden String'. Therefore, 2 gems are required.\n\n5. \"abcde\" -> 3\n   - count of 'a','b','c','d' and 'e' is 1. We can remove 'c','d' and 'e' to make the string a 'Golden String'. Therefore, 3 gems are required.\n\n6. \"abcdefgh\" -> 6\n   - count of 'a' to 'h' is 1. We can remove 'c' to 'h' to make the string a 'Golden String'. Therefore, 6 gems are required.\n\n7. \"aaaabbbbccccc\" -> 2\n   - count of 'a' is 4, count of 'b' is 4 and count of 'c' is 5. We can remove 2 'c' to make the string a 'Golden String'. Therefore, 2 gems are required.",

      "solution": "**Problem Statement**:\n\nThere is a legendary tale about Dragon Gems on Planet X: if one collects all the Dragon Gems, the Dragon God will show up and help you fulfill your wishes.\n\nOne day, you are surprised to discover that the tale might possibly be true: you found a Dragon Radar at a flea market! The radar shows you the locations of `k` Dragon Gems on Planet X. You want to waste no time checking the truth of the old legend about wish-granting for yourself!\n\nThere are `n` cities in total on Planet X, numbered from `1` to `n`. You are currently at city `1`. To travel from one city to another, you can take any of `m` bidirectional teleport trips, as many times as you like. Each teleporter connects two cities `a_i` and `b_i`, and costs `t_i` coins to use each time.\n\nTo collect a Dragon Gem, you simply need to visit the city where it's located, as indicated on your radar. It's possible that multiple Dragon Gems are at the same city; in this case, you pick all of them up at once if you visit that city.\n\nYour task is to calculate the minimum number of coins you need to spend to collect all the Dragon Gems, starting from city `1`. If it's impossible to collect all the Dragon Gems, output `-1`.\n\n**Metadata**:\n\n- **Input**:\n  - `n` (int): The number of cities. Constraints: `1 <= n <= 200000`\n  - `m` (int): The number of teleport trips. Constraints: `1 <= m <= 200000`\n  - `trips_costs` (List[Tuple[int, int, int]]): A list of tuples, where each tuple consists of `a_i`, `b_i`, `t_i`: the two cities connected by the teleport trip and the cost to use the teleporter, respectively. Constraints: `1 <= a_i, b_i <= n`, `0 <= t_i <= 10000`\n  - `k` (int): The number of Dragon Gems you need to collect. Constraints: `1 <= k <= 15`\n  - `c` (List[int]): The city IDs where the Dragon Gems are located. Constraints: `1 <= c[i] <= n` for each `i` from `1` to `k`\n  \n- **Output**:\n  - `min_coins` (int): The minimum number of coins needed to collect all Dragon Gems shown on the radar, starting from city `1`. If there is no way to complete this task, output `-1`.\n\n- **Difficulty Level**: Hard\n\n- **Problem Category**: Graph Theory, Bitmask DP, Shortest Paths\n\n- **Approximate time taken to generate the problem**: 30 minutes\n\n---\n\n**Correct Solution**:\n\nWe can model this problem as a combination of shortest path computation and bitmask dynamic programming (DP). Here's an outline of the solution:\n\n1. **Compute Shortest Paths between Relevant Cities**:\n\n   - Build the graph with the given teleport trips.\n   - Identify the relevant cities: starting city `1` and the cities containing Dragon Gems.\n   - For each relevant city, compute the shortest distances to all other cities using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n   - Construct a distance matrix containing shortest distances between all pairs of relevant cities.\n\n2. **Use Bitmask DP to Compute Minimum Cost**:\n\n   - Since the number of Dragon Gems `k` is at most 15, we can use a bitmask to represent the set of collected gems. Each bit in the mask corresponds to a Dragon Gem.\n   - Initialize a DP table `dp[mask][city_idx]` representing the minimum cost to reach `city_idx` with the set of Dragon Gems collected as per `mask`.\n   - Use a priority queue (heap) to perform state expansion efficiently.\n\n3. **State Expansion**:\n\n   - Start from the initial state: at city `1`, with any gems at city `1` collected.\n   - At each step, for the current state `(cost, mask, city_idx)`:\n     - Update the mask with any new Dragon Gems at the current city.\n     - If all gems are collected, since we use a min-heap, the first occurrence is the minimal cost.\n     - Otherwise, consider moving to other relevant cities and update the DP table if a better cost is found.\n   \n4. **Termination**:\n\n   - When we reach a state where all Dragon Gems are collected, return the cost.\n   - If the heap is exhausted and we haven't collected all gems, return `-1`.\n\nThis solution efficiently leverages Dijkstra's algorithm and bitmask DP to compute the minimum cost without exploring all possible permutations, which would be computationally infeasible.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\nimport heapq\n\ndef solution(n: int, m: int, trips_costs: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], k: int, c: List[int]) -> int:\n    if len(c) != k or k == 0:\n        return -1  #

It is guaranteed that the length of houses_robbed is m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 200).\n\nReturn the minimum number of burglaries that can happen if the houses are secured optimally.\n\n**Metadata**:\n - Difficulty level: Hard\n - Time required for problem creation: 120 minutes\n - Problem Category: HashTable\n\n**Golden unit tests**:\n\nConsider the following examples for better understanding:\n\nExample#1\nLet's say there are 4 houses with 3 roads [(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)]. Over the past 3 days, houses [2, 3, 4] were robbed. If we secure houses in the order [2, 4, 1], then the burglar can only rob house 3, resulting in a minimum of 1 burglary.\nSo, the function call will be: `minimum_burglaries(4, [(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)], [2, 3, 4])` and it should return `1`\n\nExample#2\nLet's say there are 3 houses with 2 roads [(1,2), (2,3)]. Over the past 3 days, houses [2, 1, 3] were robbed. If we secure houses in the order [2, 3, 1], then the burglar can not rob any house, resulting in a minimum of 0 burglaries.\nSo, the function call will be: `minimum_burglaries(3, [(1,2), (2,3)], [2, 1, 3])` and it should return `0` \n\nExample#3\nLet's say there are 5 houses with 4 roads [(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5)]. Over the past 5 days, houses [2, 3, 4, 5, 1] were robbed. If we secure houses in the order [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], then the burglar can only rob house 1, resulting in a minimum of 1 burglaries.\nSo, the function call will be: `minimum_burglaries(5, [(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5)], [2, 3, 4, 5, 1])` and it should return `1` \n\nExample#4\nLet's say there are 3 houses with 2 roads [(1,2), (2,3)]. Over the past 3 days, houses [2, 2, 3] were robbed. If we secure houses in the order [3, 1, 2], then the burglar can not rob any house, resulting in a minimum of 0 burglaries.\nSo, the function call will be: `minimum_burglaries(3, [(1,2), (2,3)], [2, 2, 3])` and it should return `0` \n\nExample#5\nIf there is only 1 house in the city and that house was robbed twice over the past 2 days, the function should return `1` as the minimum number of burglaries. This is because securing the house on the first day will prevent the burglary on the second day.\nSo, the function call will be: `minimum_burglaries(1, [], [1, 1])` and it should return `1` \n\nExample#6\nIf there are 2 houses in the city connected by a road and both houses were robbed on consecutive days, the function should return `1` as the minimum number of burglaries. This is because securing the first house that was robbed will prevent the burglary of the second house on the second day.\nSo, the function call will be: `minimum_burglaries(2, [(1, 2)], [1, 2])` and it should return `1` \n\nNote: In examples 5 and 6, the houses can be secured in any order as the result will be the same.",

The radar shows you the locations of the seven Dragon Balls on Planet X. Eager to test the legend, you decide to collect all seven Dragon Balls.\n\nPlanet X has `n` cities, numbered from `1` to `n`. You are currently at city `1`. To travel between cities, you can use any of the `m` bidirectional teleporters available. The `i`-th teleporter allows you to travel between cities `a_i` and `b_i` at a cost of `t_i` coins each time you use it. You can use the teleporters as many times as you like.\n\nTo collect a Dragon Ball, you simply need to visit the city where it is located, as indicated on your radar. It's possible that multiple Dragon Balls are located in the same city; in that case, you will collect all of them upon visiting that city.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum number of coins required to collect all seven Dragon Balls and return to city `1`.

Each entry `graph[u]` contains tuples `(v, w)`, representing a teleporter from city `u` to city `v` with cost `w`.\n\n2. **Dragon Ball Mapping**: We create a dictionary `city_to_balls` that maps each city to a bitmask of Dragon Balls located there. Since there are 7 Dragon Balls, we use a 7-bit number, where each bit represents a specific Dragon Ball.\n\n3. **Relevant Cities**: We identify all the cities relevant to our problem\u2014cities where Dragon Balls are located and the starting city `1`. We create a mapping `city_to_index` to map these cities to indices for easy reference in our DP table.\n\n4. **Shortest Paths Preprocessing**: We precompute the shortest distances between every pair of relevant cities using Dijkstra's algorithm. This gives us a distance matrix `dist_matrix` that we can use to quickly look up the cost of traveling between any two relevant cities.\n\n5. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: We initialize a DP table `dp[mask][city_idx]`, where `mask` represents the set of collected Dragon Balls, and `city_idx` is the index of the current city in `relevant_cities`. `dp[mask][city_idx]` stores the minimum cost required to reach city `city_idx` having collected the Dragon Balls as per `mask`.\n\n6. **State Exploration**: We use a priority queue `heap` to explore states in order of increasing cost. For each state, we consider moving to every other relevant city and update the DP table if we find a cheaper way to reach a state.\n\n7. **Termination Condition**: If we reach a state where all Dragon Balls are collected (`mask == (1 << 7) - 1`) and we're back at the starting city `1`, we return the accumulated cost.\n\n8. **No Solution Case**: If we exhaust all possible states without satisfying the termination condition, we return `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to collect all Dragon Balls.\n\n**Golden unit tests**:\n\n```python\ndef test_solution():\n    # Test Case 1\n    n1 = 10\n    m1 = 9\n    trips_costs1 = [\n        (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1),\n        (4, 5, 1), (5, 6, 1), (6, 7, 1),\n        (7, 8, 1), (8, 9, 1), (9, 10, 1)\n    ]\n    c1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n    assert solution(n1, m1, trips_costs1, c1) == 6\n\n    # Test Case 2\n    n2 = 5\n    m2 = 5\n    trips_costs2 = [\n        (1, 2, 0), (1, 3, 0), (2, 3, 1),\n        (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 1)\n    ]\n    c2 = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]\n    assert solution(n2, m2, trips_costs2, c2) == 1\n\n    # Test Case 3 (All Dragon Balls in starting city)\n    n3 = 5\n    m3 = 4\n    trips_costs3 = [\n        (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1),\n        (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 1)\n    ]\n    c3 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n    assert solution(n3, m3, trips_costs3, c3) == 0\n\n    # Test Case 4 (Disconnected Graph)\n    n4 = 4\n    m4 = 2\n    trips_costs4 = [\n        (1, 2, 1), (3, 4, 1)\n    ]\n    c4 = [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n    assert solution(n4, m4, trips_costs4, c4) == -1\n\n    # Test Case 5 (Multiple Dragon Balls in same city)\n    n5 = 6\n    m5 = 5\n    trips_costs5 = [\n        (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1),\n        (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 1), (5, 6, 1)\n    ]\n    c5 = [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]\n    assert solution(n5, m5, trips_costs5, c5) == 5\n\n    # Test Case 6 (Large Input)\n    n6 = 200000\n    m6 = 200000\n    # Creating a line graph for simplicity\n    trips_costs6 = [(i, i + 1, 1) for i in range(1, n6)]\n    c6 = [1, 50000, 100000, 150000, 200000, 75000, 125000]\n    # Expected cost is the sum of distances between the cities with Dragon Balls\n    # Since the graph is a line and costs are 1, cost would be the distance between positions\n    # For large inputs, we cannot run this test here, but it serves as a placeholder\n\n    print(\"All test cases pass.\")\n\ntest_solution()\n```\n\n**Explanation of Unit Tests**:\n\n- **Test Case 1**: Basic test where the cities are connected in a straight line, and Dragon Balls are located sequentially from city `1` to `7`. Expected minimum coins required is `6`.\n  \n- **Test Case 2**: Test with zero-cost teleporters and multiple Dragon Balls in the same cities. Expected minimum coins required is `1`.\n\n- **Test Case 3**: All Dragon Balls are located in the starting city `1`. Expected minimum coins required is `0`.\n\n- **Test Case 4**: Disconnected graph where it's impossible to reach some Dragon Balls. Expected result is `-1`.\n\n- **Test Case 5**: All Dragon Balls are located in the last city `6`. Expected minimum coins required is the cost to reach city `6` from the starting city `1`.\n\n- **Test Case 6**: Stress test with maximum input sizes. While we cannot run this test here due to limitations, it serves to ensure that the algorithm scales appropriately.\n\n**Note**: The unit tests provided can be used to verify the correctness of the solution. Test Case 6 is a placeholder to illustrate handling of large inputs and would require appropriate computational resources to execute.",
