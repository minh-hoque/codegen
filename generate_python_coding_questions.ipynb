      "   - The problem is described in a language-agnostic way, making it accessible to a wide audience.\n",

      "   - The input and output specifications are clear and concise, with appropriate constraints that guide the implementation.\n",

      "   - The solution correctly implements Kruskal's algorithm using a Union-Find data structure, which is optimal for this problem.\n",
      "   - The time complexity of O(m log m) is appropriate given the constraints, as sorting the edges is the most time-consuming operation.\n",
      "   - The space complexity of O(n) is also optimal, as it only requires storing the parent and rank arrays for the Union-Find structure.\n",
      "   - The solution is implemented in Python using only standard libraries, and the function is type-annotated, enhancing readability and maintainability.\n",

      "- **Initialization:**\n",
      "  - `max_essence_at`: Keeps track of the maximum essence collected upon reaching each spring.\n",
      "  - Set `max_essence_at[s] = essence[s]` since we start at spring `s` and collect its essence.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Traversal:**\n",
      "  - We perform a BFS traversal using a queue.\n",
      "  - For each current spring, we consider moving to adjacent springs if the flow cost constraint is satisfied.\n",
      "  - We update `max_essence_at[neighbor]` if we find a path that yields more essence.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Flow Cost Constraint:**\n",
      "  - We can only traverse to a neighbor if `current_essence >= cost`.\n",
      "  - The flow cost is not deducted from our essence; it only determines whether the traversal is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Updating Maximum Essence:**\n",
      "  - When moving to a neighbor, we accumulate the essence of the neighbor.\n",
      "  - We update `max_essence_at[neighbor]` if the new essence is greater than the existing value.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Result:**\n",
      "  - After the traversal, we return the maximum value in `max_essence_at`, which represents the maximum essence collectible.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Time Complexity:**\n",
      "  - The time complexity is `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the number of springs and `m` is the number of rivers. This is acceptable given the constraints.\n",

      "- Rationale: The problem statement is well-defined and presents a clear and solvable coding challenge. It involves traversing a directed graph with constraints, which is a common problem type in computer science, particularly in graph theory and dynamic programming. The problem is described in a language-agnostic manner, making it accessible to a wide audience. The difficulty level is appropriate for a Leetcode Medium problem, requiring a good understanding of graph traversal techniques and dynamic programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solution provided is correct and efficiently solves the problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The use of a queue for BFS ensures that the solution explores all possible paths while respecting the flow cost constraints. The solution is type-annotated and uses only standard Python libraries, adhering to the problem's requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time complexity of the solution is O(n + m), which is optimal given the constraints, as it processes each node and edge at most once. The space complexity is also reasonable, primarily determined by the storage of the graph and the queue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unit tests are comprehensive and cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases such as disconnected graphs, cycles, and high flow costs. These tests ensure that the solution is robust and handles various input configurations correctly.\n",

      "The provided solution effectively calculates the minimum fuel capacity required for the truck to traverse all nodes and return to the starting node by leveraging Dijkstra's algorithm to find the maximum distance to any node. The unit tests validate different scenarios to ensure the solution handles edge cases correctly.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "- Result: ACCEPT\n",
      "\n",
      "- Rationale: The provided solution meets the acceptance criteria outlined for the problem statement, input/output specification, and correct solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - **Problem Statement**: The problem is well-defined, describing a graph traversal scenario where the goal is to determine the minimum fuel capacity required for a truck to complete a delivery route. The problem is presented in a language-agnostic manner and requires critical thinking to solve, aligning with a Leetcode Medium difficulty level.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - **Input/Output Spec**: The input and output specifications are clear and concise. The variable names are generic and descriptive, and the constraints are well-defined. The behavior for invalid inputs (unreachable nodes) is specified, with the function returning -1 in such cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - **Correct Solution**: The solution correctly implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from the starting node to all other nodes. It checks for unreachable nodes and calculates the minimum fuel capacity as twice the maximum distance to ensure the truck can return to the starting node. The solution is efficient, with a time complexity of \\(O(E \\log V)\\), which is appropriate for the given constraints. The function is type-annotated, and the implementation uses only standard Python libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - **Unit Tests**: The provided unit tests cover a range of scenarios, including basic functionality, disconnected graphs, graphs with uniform edge weights, and minimal graphs. These tests ensure the solution's correctness and robustness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the solution is well-structured, correctly formatted, and meets the problem's requirements, making it suitable for acceptance.\n",

      "**Explanation**:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Stoer-Wagner Algorithm**: This algorithm repeatedly contracts the graph to find the global minimum cut. In each phase, it selects the most tightly connected node to the current set and updates the weights accordingly. The minimum cut found during these phases is the global minimum cut of the graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Graph Construction**:\n",
      "  - The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix `graph`, where `graph[u][v]` stores the total cost between city `u` and city `v`.\n",
      "  - Adjustments are made for 0-based indexing since Python lists are 0-indexed.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Unit Tests**:\n",
      "  - An additional test case is added where the minimum cut does not occur between nodes `1` and `n` to ensure that the algorithm correctly computes the global minimum cut.\n",
      "  - The unit tests cover various scenarios, including cycles and different configurations of edge weights, to validate the correctness of the solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Time and Space Complexity**:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Time Complexity**: The Stoer-Wagner algorithm runs in \\(O(n^3)\\) time, which is acceptable given the constraints (\\(1 \\leq n \\leq 1000\\)).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Space Complexity**: The graph is stored in an \\(n \\times n\\) adjacency matrix, resulting in \\(O(n^2)\\) space complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note**:\n",
      "\n",
      "This solution correctly computes the global minimum cut as required by the problem statement, ensuring that the partition of the cities minimizes the total teleportation costs between the two groups.\n"
